  "Duplicate code":
    "To maintain a high-quality codebase, it's generally recommended to follow the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). This principle advocates for reducing the repetition of software patterns by abstracting common patterns into a single, reusable piece of code. This not only improves maintainability but also enhances the overall integrity and readability of the code.",
  "Consider refactoring":
    "Refactoring a loop to use lambdas and streams in Java can significantly improve code readability, maintainability, and brevity. Streams, paired with lambdas, allow for more declarative and succinct expression of operations like filtering and mapping. This enhances readability and reduces error likelihood compared to traditional loops. Moreover, streams are easily parallelizable, potentially improving performance for large collections or intensive computations. However, their suitability varies depending on the complexity and performance requirements of the task.",
  "Access modifier":
    "More restrictive access modifiers contribute to better software design by promoting encapsulation, improving maintainability, reducing bugs, clarifying API usage, enhancing security, and simplifying testing and debugging. However, it's also important to balance the use of restrictive access with the need for flexibility and functionality in your code.",
